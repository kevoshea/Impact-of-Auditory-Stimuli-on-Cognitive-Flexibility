# Impact of Auditory Stimuli on Cognitive Flexibility
 The aim of the project is to measure and analyse the effect of auditory stimuli on human cognitive ability. 48 members of the public were subjected to a variety of Stroop-like tests with a range of accompanying audio. Response times were catalogued and contrasted to examine the effects of audio on participants. There were five tests in total, including one control test to measure user reaction time. Of the remaining four tests, one had no audio while the other three had music, construction noise and spoken word. The majority of users improved as the test proceeded, leading to lower response times in general. Analysis of test data showed that there were some minor differences in performance between genders, implying that this could be an area worthy of further research. Keywords - Stroopt test, data analysis, auditory stimuli, control of attention, cognitive ability.
